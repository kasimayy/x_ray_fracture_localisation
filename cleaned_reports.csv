There is subtle splaying and irregularity of the distal femoral metaphyses bilaterally. The medial aspect of the distal femoral physis appears slightly widened but this may be projectional. The proximal tibial physis and metaphysis appear entirely normal bilaterally, as do the distal femoral and proximal tibial epiphyses. Alignment is normal. There is no focal bone lesion.

Comment:
Subtle metaphyseal abnormality in both distal femurs which, although not entirely typical, may be due to rickets. Suggest correlation with bone biochemistry and paediatric referral. 
A followup radiograph in 3 months would also be appropriate to assess change in the x-ray appearances."

Incidentally, the lateral projection demonstrates a confined sclerotic density seen within the proximal tibial medullary cavity. This has not changed since previous images dated 10/07/2012. Differential appearances are of a bony infarct or calcified enchondroma. Further tibia/fibula projections recommended to image it's entirety and for further review. It is up to the referring clinician to decide if this warrants requesting further cross-sectional imaging. Placed in alerts folder. 

There is increased loss of joint space and sclerotic appearances within the medial femoral tibial compartment. There is moderate patellofemoral joint degeneration seen which is consistent with previous imaging.
