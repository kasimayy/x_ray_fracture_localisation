No large effusion.

There is a linear coarse periosteal reaction along the proximal shafts of the fibula and tibia, more so on the right and along the medial aspect of the distal right femur. No previous images available for comparison. This can be seen in chronic venous insufficiency however hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy associated with suppurative pulmonary disorders or neoplasia is in the differential and a chest radiograph is recommended in the first instance for completeness.

Bilateral knee pain last 3 months with no history of injury.
Osteoarthritis?

Bone density is preserved. There is loss of joint space bilaterally within the medial compartments with lateral maltracking of the patella. There is spurring of the intercondylar notch of the tibia.

Interpretation: Confirmation of the clinical suspicion of bilateral osteoarthritic change. The dominant symptom generator, may be patellofemoral dysfunction. Physiotherapy recommended.
