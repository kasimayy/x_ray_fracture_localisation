Degenerative changes and osteopenic bones noted.

XR Lumbar spine : 
No previous radiographs for comparison. No acute bony abnormality seen. 

Multilevel degenerative changes seen with associated anterior osteophytosis. Vertebral body heights are maintained throughout. Significant loss of disc space seen between L5/S1 and L1/L2. In particular, the inferior endplate of L1 and superior endplate of L2 appear marginally sclerotic in keeping with degenerative change.

There is a minimal anterior translation of L5 over S1 of less than 10% in keeping with a grade 1 spondylolistheses. Associated increased hypertrophic appearances seem over the L5-S1 pars interarticularis, were chronic spondylolysis should be considered.

XR Knee Both : 

X-ray left knee
No acute bony abnormality seen. Normal alignment. No effusions.
There is mild loss of joint is seen within the medial femoral tibial compartment. Prominent intercondylar eminence is seen.

X-ray right knee
No acute bony abnormality seen. Normal alignment. Bipartite patella. No effusions.
There is mild loss of joint is seen within the medial femoral tibial compartment. Prominent intercondylar eminence is seen.

XR Hip Both : 
Pelvis has not been projected in all entirety. No acute bony abnormality seen. Normal alignment. 

Bilateral mild degenerative hip changes seen. Enthesopathy seen over the inferior pubic rami bilaterally.

XR Foot Both : 
Bilateral DP projections demonstrated.

Bilateral significant loss of joint space is seen within the tarsal-metatarsal joint spaces in keeping with arthropathy.
Bilateral lateral deviations of the first metatarsal phalangeal joints with marked increase articular surface sclerotic formations. Appearances in keeping with significant bilateral hallux valgus.
Significant bilateral loss of joint space seen within the distal interphalangeal joint spaces and proximal interphalangeal joint spaces.

Lateral foot projections is recommended to fully assess the tarsal zone.

XR Hand Both : 
Bilateral DP hand projections.

X-ray right hand
Significant loss of joint space seen within the first carpometacarpal joint space with increased marked sclerotic articular formation. Pencil-cup degenerative change seen within the proximal interphalangeal joint spaces. Loss of joint space seen within the distal interphalangeal joint spaces. 

Marked minimal foreshortening seen of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints, with the third and fourth phalangeal joints are well preserved.

Significant loss of joint space seen within the first carpometacarpal joint space with increased marked sclerotic articular formation.

Worsening pain both knees, right more than left, crepitus? OA.

AP and  lateral radiographs of both knees.

Right.
Moderate degenerative joint space loss involving the medial tibiofemoral compartment and mild joint space loss involving the lateral and patellofemoral compartments. There is associated tibiofemoral osteophytosis. No large effusion.

Left.
Moderate medial tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joint space loss.
No large effusion.

There is a linear coarse periosteal reaction along the proximal shafts of the fibula and tibia, more so on the right and along the medial aspect of the distal right femur. No previous images available for comparison. This can be seen in chronic venous insufficiency however hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy associated with suppurative pulmonary disorders or neoplasia is in the differential and a chest radiograph is recommended in the first instance for completeness.

Femoral-tibial component alignement is maintained. The femoral component is well situated with no obvious radiolucencies or periprosthetic fractures. The tibial tray is aligned well with the tibial  plateau with no obvious radiolucencies or periprosthetic fractures. 

There is some minimal varus angulation of the proximal tibia. This could be positional.

Calcification within the posterior soft tissue again is seen. Likely differential is calcified bursal cyst.

Clinical information
Bilateral knee pain last 3 months with no history of injury.
Osteoarthritis?

Bone density is preserved. There is loss of joint space bilaterally within the medial compartments with lateral maltracking of the patella. There is spurring of the intercondylar notch of the tibia.

Interpretation: Confirmation of the clinical suspicion of bilateral osteoarthritic change. The dominant symptom generator, may be patellofemoral dysfunction. Physiotherapy recommended.
